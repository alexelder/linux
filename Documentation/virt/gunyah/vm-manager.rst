Virtual Machine Manager
=======================

The Gunyah Virtual Machine Manager is a Linux driver to support launching
virtual machines using Gunyah. It presently supports launching non-proxy
scheduled Linux-like virtual machines.

Except for some basic information about the location of initial binaries,
most of the configuration about a Gunyah virtual machine is described in the
VM's devicetree. The devicetree is generated by userspace. Interacting with the
virtual machine is still done via the kernel and VM configuration requires some
of the corresponding functionality to be set up in the kernel. For instance,
sharing userspace memory with a VM is done via the `GH_VM_SET_USER_MEM_REGION`_
ioctl. The VM itself is configured to use the memory region via the
devicetree.

Sample Userspace VMM
====================

A sample userspace VMM is included in samples/gunyah/ along with a minimal
devicetree that can be used to launch a VM. To build this sample, enable
CONFIG_SAMPLE_GUNYAH.

IOCTLs and userspace VMM flows
==============================

The kernel exposes a char device interface at /dev/gunyah.

To create a VM, use the `GH_CREATE_VM`_ ioctl. A successful call will return a
"Gunyah VM" file descriptor.

/dev/gunyah API Descriptions
----------------------------

GH_CREATE_VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates a Gunyah VM. The argument is reserved for future use and must be 0.

Gunyah VM API Descriptions
--------------------------

GH_VM_SET_USER_MEM_REGION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ioctl allows the user to create or delete a memory parcel for a guest
virtual machine. Each memory region is uniquely identified by a label;
attempting to create two regions with the same label is not allowed. Labels are
unique per virtual machine.

While VMM is guest-agnostic and allows runtime addition of memory regions,
Linux guest virtual machines do not support accepting memory regions at runtime.
Thus, memory regions should be provided before starting the VM and the VM must
be configured to accept these at boot-up.

The guest physical address is used by Linux kernel to check that the requested
user regions do not overlap and to help find the corresponding memory region
for calls like `GH_VM_SET_DTB_CONFIG`_. It must be page aligned.

To add a memory region, call `GH_VM_SET_USER_MEM_REGION`_ with fields set as
described above.

GH_VM_SET_DTB_CONFIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ioctl sets the location of the VM's devicetree blob and is used by Gunyah
Resource Manager to allocate resources. The guest physical memory should be part
of the primary memory parcel provided to the VM prior to GH_VM_START.

GH_VM_START
~~~~~~~~~~~

This ioctl starts the VM.
